# Surykatka
[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/org.clojars.jj/surykatka.svg)](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.jj/surykatka)

A Clojure library that identifies file type based on magic numbers.

## Installation
Add surykatka to your dependency list with:

```[org.clojars.jj/surykatka "1.0.0"]```

## Usage

``` clojure
(:require [jj.surykatka :as surykatka])

(= :postscript (surykatka/get-file-type (.readAllBytes (FileInputStream. (File. "test/resources/file.ps"))))) 
(= "image/jpeg" (surykatka/get-mime (.readAllBytes (FileInputStream. (File. "test/resources/file.jpg"))))) 
```
If verification of trailing bytes is not wanted:
``` clojure
(= "image/jpeg" (surykatka/get-mime (.readAllBytes (FileInputStream. (File. "test/resources/file.jpg"))) {:check-footer false} )) 
```
