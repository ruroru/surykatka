# Surykatka

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/org.clojars.jj/surykatka.svg)](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.jj/surykatka)

A Clojure library that identifies file type based on magic numbers.

## Installation

Add surykatka to your dependency list with:

```[org.clojars.jj/surykatka "1.3.1"]```

## Usage

``` clojure
(:require [jj.surykatka :as surykatka])

;; byte array
(= :postscript (surykatka/get-file-type (.readAllBytes (FileInputStream. (File. "test/resources/file.ps"))))) 
(= "image/jpeg" (surykatka/get-mime (.readAllBytes (FileInputStream. (File. "test/resources/file.jpg"))))) 

;; Or InputStream
(= :jpeg (surykatka/get-file-type (FileInputStream. (File. ^String file-path))))


```

If verification of trailing bytes is not wanted:

``` clojure
(= "image/jpeg" (surykatka/get-mime (.readAllBytes (FileInputStream. (File. "test/resources/file.jpg"))) {:check-footer false} )) 
```

# Limitations
* **Footer verification is disabled** when using InputStream inputs. Only header-based file type detection is performed since the library reads only the first 512 bytes for efficiency.
* **Stream consumption**: InputStreams are partially consumed during file type detection. If you need to use the same InputStream after detection, wrap it with a `BufferedInputStream` and call `mark()` before passing it to the detection functions, then `reset()` afterward to rewind the stream.
